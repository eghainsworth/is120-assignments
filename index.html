        <h1>First Three Weeks of Junior Year</h1>
        <article>
            <h2>Things are getting serious...</h2>
            <p>Starting my third year at BYU has been sort of a crazy experience. When did I turn into one of the older kids on campus? How is everyone in all of my classes married?</p>
            <p>But yes, it's true: <em>I'm an adult now.</em> A real one. </p>

            <h2>Stress and snacks</h2>
            <p>I found myself feeling pretty stressed these past few weeks, but I did notice that there were some good ways to deal with it. My favorite way was probably meeting up with friends to eat snacks on campus.</p>

            <p>I'm definitely grateful to have my older brother on campus as well!</p>
            <h3>Here's an overview of what I'm learning in each of my classes this semester. </h3>
            <dl>
                <dt>Social Development</dt>
                <dd>In this class, I am learning about how we as humans develop our social skills and the schemas and scripts surrounding social interactions. It seems pretty interesting, but there is way too much reading.</dd>
                <dt>Media, Family and Human Development</dt>
                <dd>This class is all about media. Finally, a reason to be on Instragram while I'm studying!</dd>
                <dt>Adolescent Development</dt>
                <dd>I'm learning all about what it is like to be a teenager. Luckily for me, those years aren't too far gone. I remember them all too well!</dd>
                <dt>Intuitive Eating</dt>
                <dd>This class is teaching me all about intuitive eating and body image. This class has helped me really focus on my goal to cook more and nourish my body this year.</dd>
                <dt>Web Design</dt>
                <dd>Web Design is sort of kicking my butt. I have no idea what is going on most of the time, but I am definitely excited to learn more. </dd>

        <h2>My Best Tips for Surviving BYU</h2>
        <p>Being in college is hard, but with some tips from a seasoned veteran, you might get a head start on figuring the whole thing out.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Figure out what Learning Suite is. I didn't know what it was for the first week of my freshman year. That was unfortunate.</li>
            <li>Sort through your reading to find what is actually important. Most classes assign more reading than you will ever need. Learn to skim!</li>
            <li>Always pack a snack when you come to campus. Here are some of my favorite snacks!
                <ul>
                    <li>Pretzels</li>
                    <li>Jalepeno cheddar cheetos</li>
                    <li>Monte Cristo Sandwiches</li>
                    <li>Chocolate Milk</li>
                    <li>Hi Chews</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Finally, just have fun with school. Life is meant to be enjoyed, and education can be a great source of joy!</li>
